              DATASET USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)</b></pre>
              <hr>
              <br>
    <h3>Experiment</h3>
    <p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, here we consider the chest CT scan image dataset from Kaggle,
        which consists of 1252 Covid and1229 non-covid images [fig14.1 shows a portion of covid and fig14.2 shows a portion
        of non-covid dataset]. The size of CT scan images in the data set may vary and it can be of different types (color, gray,
        etc), formats (.jpg, jpeg, etc), and resolutions. The proposed method is applied in the Python environment, version 3.7,
        with the hardware configuration of an Intel processor (Core i5), a RAM of 8GB size, and a graphics card of 4GB size. We
        have used the anaconda as a distributor of python. Through an anaconda navigator, we are running the base environment,
        which will be useful to access the Jupiter notebook as an open web application source and to run our code.It produces
        good results better than earlier methods and safer F1 and accuracy score calculation.</p>

        <br>
    <h3>Conclusion and Future Scope</h3>
        <p>This paper illustrates the classification of covid and non-covid chest CT scan images based on reinforcement learningbased deep-CNN model. The combination of reinforcement learning and deep learning while designing CNN the layered
            architecture makes our model unique. The proposed method is tested on the Kaggle chest CT scan dataset. The
            experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and F1 score. Some concluding
            observations regarding this paper are - The proposed algorithm gives a better result in terms of accuracy and F1 score
            concerning other existing techniques. The accuracy score is 87%, F1_score is 0.87, recall rate is 0.87 and precision rate
            0.87 are obtained for our proposed method. It applies to large datasets. We find that it is very
            simple and efficient. In the future accuracy and F1 score may be improved. Several other matrices can be included in our
            proposed technique to measure the performance such as precision score, recall score, roc, etc. In the future, this model
            can be utilized to categorize other kind of covid variantsâ€™ borne diseases.</p>
